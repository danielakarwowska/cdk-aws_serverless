# cdk-aws_serverless

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkServerlessStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


Once you have saved the file, you can use the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to update your Lambda function with the new code. After the update is complete, you can call the API endpoint associated with the Lambda function to fetch data from the ECS cluster.
This code will use the AWS.ECS SDK to fetch data about the services running in the ECS cluster. It will return a JSON response containing information such as the name of the cluster, the name of each service, the number of desired and running tasks for each service, and the CPU and memory usage for each service.

Yes, you can create a new file called ecs-data.ts (or any other name you prefer) in the src folder of your AWS Lambda function. Then, paste the code you provided into the ecs-data.ts file.

Sure, here's an example of how you can customize the Lambda function to fetch data from the ECS cluster and return it in the format I provided earlier.

First, you can modify the handler function in the ecs-api.ts file to use the AWS SDK API to fetch data from the ECS cluster. Here's an example implementation that retrieves information about all services in the cluster:

typescript
Copy code
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { APIGatewayProxyEvent, APIGatewayProxyResult } from 'aws-lambda';

export async function handler(event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> {
  const ecs = new AWS.ECS();
  const clusterName = process.env.CLUSTER_NAME;

  try {
    const services = await ecs.listServices({ cluster: clusterName }).promise();
    const serviceArns = services.serviceArns;

    const serviceDescriptions = await ecs.describeServices({ cluster: clusterName, services: serviceArns }).promise();
    const serviceDetails = serviceDescriptions.services;

    const response = {
      clusterName,
      services: serviceDetails.map(service => ({
        serviceName: service.serviceName,
        desiredCount: service.desiredCount,
        runningCount: service.runningCount,
        pendingCount: service.pendingCount,
        cpu: {
          reserved: service.cpu?.reserved || 0,
          available: service.cpu?.available || 0,
        },
        memory: {
          reserved: service.memory?.reserved || 0,
          available: service.memory?.available || 0,
        },
        healthStatus: service.healthStatus,
      })),
    };

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(response),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);

    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'An error occurred while fetching data from the ECS cluster.' }),
    };
  }
}
This implementation uses the AWS.ECS class to list all services in the cluster, then retrieves detailed information about each service using the describeServices method. The Lambda function then maps the service descriptions to a more concise response format, including only the information we want to display in the dashboard.

Next, you can modify the bin/ecs-api.ts file to specify the name of your ECS cluster using an environment variable. Here's an example:

typescript
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env node
import 'source-map-support/register';
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { EcsApiStack } from '../lib/ecs-api-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new EcsApiStack(app, 'EcsApiStack', {
  env: {
    region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION,
    account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT,
  },
  clusterName: 'my-ecs-cluster-name', // replace with your own cluster name
});
Note the clusterName property that we've added to the EcsApiStack constructor. You can replace 'my-ecs-cluster-name' with the name of your own ECS cluster.

Finally, you can deploy the updated AWS CDK app by running cdk deploy again. After the deployment is complete, you can call the API endpoint using curl or a tool like Postman to fetch data from the ECS cluster, as I explained earlier.
